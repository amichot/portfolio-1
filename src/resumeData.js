        "Achievements":"When I was first hired at Mumms, I quickly realized they were using old technologies EVERYWHERE. Development tasks were taking way longer than what they should have because of the older stuff. I started showing them all of the new things I had just learned and they were instantly sold, we started phasing out all of the old code and started pulling out functionality from these massive bulky slow plain JavaScript/jQuery apps and building micro-apps as react components that we could pass around and install into any of ours apps easily. By doing so we were able to improve the QOL of all of the developers, making the work environment much easier and quicker to work in, as well as get features out quicker and with less bugs!"
